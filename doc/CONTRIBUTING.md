# Contributing

## 👨‍💻 Our TechStack

- **GitLab** : We use GitLab to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept merge requests. DevOps Platform used for CI/CD and version control.
- **Django** : Python Web Framework to create robust API's.
- **Docker** : A standardized way of packaging the application with all its dependencies and deploying it in any environment.


## 🚀 Setup Your Development Environment

Before you start contributing to the project, you need to set up your development environment. Please follow the instructions in our setup guides:

- **[Development Environment Setup Guide (PDF)](setup_dev_env_back.pdf)**
- **[Project Startup Guide (Markdown)](project_startup_guide.md)**

Make sure you follow these guides carefully to ensure your development environment is set up correctly and you are able to start up the project without any issues.

## Setup Gitlab

  We use some strategies to facilitate collaboration. We strongly advice to read this **[Setup Gitlab](setup_gitlab.md)** page to see how we use gitlab.

  ### We Use a Merge Request Template

  We have set up a merge request template to streamline the contribution process. Please fill it out to the best of your ability.

  ### We Use a Labelling System

  Our label system helps in categorizing and tracking the progress of issues and merge requests:

  - **Status**: Work In Progress, Review Needed, Changes Requested, etc.
  - **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, Critical.
  - **Type**: Bug, Feature, Improvement, Documentation, Refactor.
  - **Size**: XS, S, M, L, XL.

  When creating a merge request, apply the labels that best describe your submission.


## 🚨 Use a Consistent Coding Style

- You can use `pre-commit` for linting and auto-formatting as mentionned in the **[Project Startup Guide (Markdown)](project_startup_guide.md)**
